          help you. You will study in our course, find answers to your questions
          and acquire a lot of knowledge during our course. If your level of
          knowledge is high, you can conditionally transfer to the next classes.
          PHP, React, Java, JavaScript, SCRATCH, C++) You can go to the next
          programming language by attending a class of the programming language
          you are interested in. The main thing is that you are interested in
          the class and the field of programming, that's enough. Because if you
          are interested in the first place, you can easily overcome all the
          difficulties.

        Computer programming is different for the computer microprocessor giving
        commands, when, where, what to change and what is to issue input or
        output commands. In this article, what programming languages are there,
        the most common programming languages and their differences. Also, Ways
        to Learn Programming We will talk about many programming languages in
        the computer world is available and the number of people interested in
        programming is increasing. Programs that do the same type of work are
        called Basic, Pascal, Ci, and can be written in other languages. Pascal,
        Fortran and Cobol languages are considered universal languages, Ci and
        Assembler languages are considered to be a mash language are more
        closely related languages and are lower or intermediate languages. The
        closer an algorithmic language is to human languages, the higher it is
        is called a graded language. And machine language is the lowest level
        language. The main principles of character-coded languages are that
        machine codes are marked with corresponding symbols, and memory
        automatic allocation and error diagnosis are included. Such the language
        adapted to the machine was named ASSEMBLER language. Usually programming
        high-level programming languages (Delphi, Java, C++, Python) is carried
        out through This is the semantics of programming languages Due to its
        closeness to human language, the process of programming is much easier
        will pass. Commonly used programming languages. We know now and all
        languages used belong to this group.The first appearance It can be used
        from ancient languages to modern languages. But in languages that work
        through current web technology (PHP, ASP.NET, JSP) such programs are not
        created. Because of such programs another application must be running
        for it to work. Now, application programs, mainly Visual C++, C#,
        Borland Delphi, Borland C++, Compiled in languages such as Java, Phyhon.
        Most people in Uzbekistan are Delphi uses . Java code files are
        converted to bytecode after compilation is passed and this bytecode is
        read by the interpreter. C++ (pronounced: si plus plus) is designed for
        various purposes programming language. C by Biyarne Stroustrup at Bell
        Labs in 1979 extending the capabilities of the programming language and
        OOP(object Developed in order to introduce the Oriented Programming
        feature issued. Originally called "C with Classes", 1983 to present
        renamed to C++. C++ programs written in C can compile, but the C
        compiler does not have this feature. C++ language parts related to
        operating systems, client-server programs, EHM games, used in daily
        needs programs and similar programs used for various purposes used in
        production.
